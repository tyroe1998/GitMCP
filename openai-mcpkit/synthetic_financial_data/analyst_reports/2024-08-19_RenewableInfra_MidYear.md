# Renewable Infrastructure Mid-Year Update

- Firm: Westshore Capital Markets
- Analyst: Priya Verma, CFA
- Coverage: Sunward Renewables (SUNR.N), GridFlex Partners (GFXP.O)
- Rating Changes: SUNR.N reiterated `Outperform`; GFXP.O upgraded to `Market Perform`
- Price Targets: SUNR.N to $42 (from $40); GFXP.O to $31 (from $26)

## Investment Thesis
Sunward Renewables benefits from incremental U.S. grid modernization tax abatements and the commissioning of two hybrid solar-storage parks ahead of schedule. GridFlex's bid pipeline has normalized after last year's permitting delays, but margin mix is less attractive as transmission EPC contracts make up a higher share of backlog.

## Near-Term Catalysts
1. Department of Energy tranche-two resiliency grants (award notification Sept 18)
2. SUNR.N merchant pricing for ERCOT-heavy assets following the August heat wave
3. GFXP.O closing on the Prairie Wind intertie sale (target Q4 2024)

## Scenario Analysis
| Scenario | SUNR EBITDA 2025E | GFXP EBITDA 2025E | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Base Case | $612mm | $184mm | Reflects 14% blended WACC, 4% escalator |
| Bull Case | $660mm | $201mm | Adds 150 bps ITC step-up, +80 bps IRR |
| Bear Case | $545mm | $165mm | Transmission award slippage, 7% cost inflation |

## Channel Checks
- Developer survey (n=21) indicates contract labor availability improved sharply in Texas.
- EPC counterparties observe 5-7% price declines in Tier-2 solar modules.
- State-level grid operators signal no further curtailment directives in 2H.

## Risks
- Rising polysilicon prices reintroduce module scarcity by holiday season.
- ERCOT peak load reduction shortens ancillary revenue tail.
- Potential re-rating tied to U.S. election policy shift on storage credits.
