# AI Semiconductor Supply Chain Tracker

- Firm: Hudson Yard Securities
- Analyst: Miguel Espinosa
- Coverage: Satori Logic (SATL.O), NorthPeak Substrates (NPSB.K), HexaCore Fabrication (HXCF.N)
- Recommendation Summary: SATL `Buy`, NPSB `Hold`, HXCF `Sell`

## Key Takeaways
- Backend substrate lead times contracted to 14 weeks vs. 20 weeks in May.
- SATL booked $180mm in new accelerator orders from hyperscale customers with take-or-pay contracts.
- HXCF wafer starts remain 18% below plan; ASP discounts deepen as legacy nodes go idle.

## Data Points
| Metric | May 2024 | Aug 2024 | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CoWoS capacity (k wafers/mo) | 19.4 | 23.1 | Incremental lines ramping in Taiwan |
| LT substrate price ($/unit) | 128 | 121 | Spot hedges offset silver paste costs |
| Accelerator backlog (SATL, $bn) | 6.2 | 7.5 | Hyperscale mix 74% |

## Field Notes
- OSAT partner in Suzhou reported SATL escalating long-term volume commitments to secure copper foil supply.
- Channel partner in Munich flagged incremental EU data center incentives accelerating 2025 orders.
- HXCF distributors now offering 90-day free inventory carrying to clear 28nm nodes.

## Risks & Watch Items
- Earthquake exposure around Hsinchu cluster could halt CoWoS production for multiple fabs.
- Export control frameworks on advanced accelerators remain fluid into U.S. election.
- Silver paste prices trending +6% QoQ may compress substrate margins again.
