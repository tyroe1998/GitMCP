# Synthetic Financial Alternative Data Bundle

This folder aggregates mock alternative data feeds tailored for hedge fund research. Each subfolder mirrors a common vendor-delivered format and includes metadata to demonstrate how the content could be consumed programmatically.

## Contents
- `analyst_reports/`: Sell-side style PDF replacements, delivered as Markdown for ease of parsing.
- `expert_calls/`: Call notes/transcripts with speaker labels and time stamps for key insights.
- `web_search_trends/`: Structured keyword tracking pulled from simulated web search providers, stored as CSV, JSON, and TSV extracts.

Timestamps, tickers, and metrics are synthetic yet internally consistent so they can be used for pipeline prototyping or demo dashboards.
