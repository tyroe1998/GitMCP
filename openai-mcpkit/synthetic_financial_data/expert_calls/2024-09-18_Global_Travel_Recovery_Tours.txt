[00:03] Analyst: Great to catch up. What's the vibe on bookings headed into next quarter?
[00:06] Expert: Still trending the way we like it. Small-group trips—10 to 12 guests—are about 64% of bookings, up from 48% before the pandemic. Big coach tours are stuck around 55% of 2019 volume, so we aren't forcing it.

[00:18] Analyst: Are you seeing more price pressure from cruises or OTAs?
[00:20] Expert: River cruise lines are flashing 15% early-bird discounts to fill shoulder-season sailings. Instead of racing them to the bottom, we're packaging airfare credits and keeping gross margin near 21%.

[00:31] Analyst: Any shifts in what customers actually want in the itinerary?
[00:33] Expert: Food and culture themes are the star—47% of Q1 bookings are tied to culinary hooks. Adventure trips cooled off because insurance premiums doubled and people balk at the waivers.

[00:44] Analyst: Speaking of insurance, how ugly was renewal season?
[00:46] Expert: Liability cover came in 11% higher, and we added clauses for geopolitical interruptions. That cost us about 80 basis points of margin until we reprice, which we're planning for early spring departures.

[00:58] Analyst: Are folks still asking for flexible cancellation like it's 2021?
[01:00] Expert: Definitely. Our 14-day free cancel window is still the number-one question from advisors. Industry standard is closer to 30 days, so the shorter window helps us close deals.

[01:11] Analyst: What's the main thing that could derail bookings right now?
[01:13] Expert: Geo-politics, full stop. Any flare-up in Eastern Europe or the Middle East freezes inbound demand within hours. We've built a reroute playbook so we can swap itineraries without eating deposits, but it's always stressful.

[01:25] Analyst: Bottom line takeaway for investors listening in?
[01:27] Expert: Flexibility wins. Keep product nimble, guard margin with thoughtful pricing, and don't underestimate how much reassurance clients still want.
